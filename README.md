# romanNumeralConverter
Convert from Latin numbers to Romans. An Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenge from freeCodeCamp.

FreeCodeCamp has this challenge where you are supposed to convert Latin numbers into old Roman ones. 
This is basically a Javascript-challenge, but I decided to add some markup and styling to it. 

When putting the stuff on a web-page, I realized that the converter was correct only up to the number 4999. From 5000 one reuses the letters, but a line must be put on top to tell they are different from the small ones. So I had to rewrite some of the code, both HTML, CSS and and JS.
